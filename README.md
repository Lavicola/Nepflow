# Nepflow

## Introduction
Nepenthes are carnivorous plants that have found a steadily growing following in recent years, although some species can reach prices of over â‚¬100. There are numerous sources for information and pictures of different species.

[Tom's Carnivores](https://tomscarnivores.com/resources/nepenthes-interactive-guide/) offers a function to determine the climatic requirements of different species. [Marcellocatalano](https://www.marcellocatalano.com/aaa.htm)provides a code database that lists the different cloning variants of Borneo Exotics. [Cpphotofinder](https://cpphotofinder.com/Nepenthes.html)
presents an extensive picture gallery that allows you to view pictures of different species and hybrids.
The GFP (Society for Carnivorous Plants) maintains a special [subforum](https://forum.carnivoren.org/forums/forum/132-pollen/)
in their forum, which is used to find crossing partners for Nepenthes. In addition to GFP, there are various [groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1615538418599583?_rdr) on Facebook dedicated to the exchange of pollen providers and seekers.

## Motivation
In addition to the wealth of websites offering special features for Nepenthes and the ever-growing number of stores stocking these plants, the increasing variety of hybrid plants being bred underlines the fact that this hobby is in a golden age. However, one problem that currently arises from the many crosses and hybrids is that over time it becomes increasingly difficult to trace the lineage of one's own plant. Nepflow aims to help tackle this challenge. As a first step, Nepflow will function as a kind of pollen exchange platform. Users can register on the website and add their Nepenthes. On the basis of filterable attributes such as "flowering" or "soon to flower", it will then be possible to offer pollen (male) or flowers (female) of a Nepenthes in order to create a pollen exchange platform. Based on this idea, users are also given the opportunity to reference or add the parents of their plants, if known. By referencing, collecting and storing this information, users will be able to view the family tree of their own plants in the future.

## Key Tasks and Questions Nepflow aims to answer
While the Main Focus in on the Pollen Exchange, Nepflow and the underlying Datamodel aims to answer the following questions (the list is not exhaustive):
1. what is the family tree of a Nepenthes
2.  How often does a particular Nepenthes flower on a particular person?
3. which Nepenthes are crossed particularly frequently?
4. what is the crossing success rate of a user?
5. are there Nepenthes that are sterile or rarely bear seeds?
6. which clone of a Nepenthes is particularly popular

## Current Datamodel(Overview)
The data model to be developed is still in the modeling phase, but the following data model is currently being worked on
![First Draft](https://github.com/Lavicola/Nepflow/blob/master/DatamodelOverview.png)

### Nepenthes, Clone, User and NepenthesClone
- A Nepenthes is a specific Nepenthes such as "villosa".
- A Nepenthes has a Clone which can either be "seedgrown", but also clones which are propagted in an a Laboratory(Producer) with a specific code (e.g. BE-3225)
- A user grows specific Nepenthes, which represent a specific clone (once again either "seedgrown" or "propagted") 

&rarr; For more Information of the exact/different possible lables see Clone Class Diagram [Clone Class Diagram](#class-diagram-clones)
&rarr; A User cultivate cultivates specific Instances of a Clone (the so called "NepenthesClone"). Since a NepenthesClone references the Clone back we are able to reach every node but at the same time reduce super Nodes Formations since every instance of a specific Clone can be seperatly referenced in a FlowerOffer


### FlowerOffer
Since the goal is to combine a PollenExchange with a familytree for Nepenthes a User must be able to "publish" a new "FlowerOffer". This FlowerOffer contains relationships to the User and the flowering Nepenthes he offers.

&rarr; Using the "Flowers" relationship to a "FlowerOffer", the Question "how often did a specific Nepenthes bloom" answered, but also more general Questions.


### Datamodel(Species)
While the first Datamodel gives an Overview, it is missing the functionality for the PollenExchange. Therefore the following Datamodel shows an Example on how the Datamodel looks like after a Trade(PollenExchange), if two
Users have the same Species.  
![First Draft](https://github.com/Lavicola/Nepflow/blob/master/DatamodelSpecies%20.png)
The Datamodel shows two different Clones of the same species. A User with an open FlowerOffer is able to initiate a Trade where he offers a specific FlowerOffer. For the start relationship the other Party has a "pending". Using this Information the User can then either "accept" or "refuse" the trade. If the Edge is "accepted" both Parties can confirm a new "Grex" once they received their seeds.

&rarr; Using this Datamodel it is possible to prevent User creating duplicate Trades  
&rarr; Using the "initiate" edge we can track the amount of Trades a specific User initiated.  
&rarr; Using the "results_in" edge we can detect how many Trade actually resulted in a new Grex, which means we are able to track the success Rate.  
&rarr; Using this Datamodel the offspring results in a new clone Node with a relation to the Species

### Datamodel(Multihybrid)
Because all clones share many characteristics, the hybrid and multi-hybrid play a special role. 
For both, it is sometimes not possible to know the parents. For hybrids without knowledge of the parents, an "UNKOWN" clone can theoretically be introduced for each Nepenthes. These can be referenced and thus enable hybrids where one or none parent is known.
For multihybrids, however, this is too costly/time-consuming due to the many combinations and ultimately the number of hybrids contained in the multihybrid (e.g. [(lowii x veitchii) x boschiana] x [(veitchii x maxima) x veitchii] x [(spectabilis x (lowii x ventricosa)]).
Therefore multihybrids must be createable without any knowledge.

### Class Diagram Clones
In the Domain "Nepenthes" there are several different types of Clones we must introduce in order to get a full Picture of the Domain:
- A Clone itself is an abstract Type since it is missing the context.
- A "hybrid" consists of at two different types of "SpeciesClones".
- A "Multi-Hybrid" consists of at least three different species which also includes F2 hybrids e.g (villosa x hamata) x villosa
- Both "hybrid" and "Multi-Hybrid" contain a mother and father part as property
- A IVClone and a ICClone only differs in the fact that a IVClone is propagated in a laboratory (therefore has a Producer)
&rarr; Using a Graphdatabase allows us to restrict the Search space using labels

### Rough Overview of Components
![components](https://github.com/Lavicola/Nepflow/blob/master/MainComponents.png)
I am Fan of modularity and therefore I always try to realize this.
In Nepflow I am thinking roughly of four different Components:
- UserManagement
- NepenthesManagement, which is used in order to add new Clones/Nepenthes to the Application
- GrowListManagement, which realized the functionallity to add different types of Clones to a specific User and therefore needs to access information of both Components
- PollenExhcnange, which will realize the functionallity for Trades. This Components needs to access GrowlistManagement and UserManagement.

### Example of GrowlistManagement as a Graph

The yellow Nodes represent an instance of a specific Clone.
